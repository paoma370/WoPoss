                <p>WoPoss’s principal investigator, Francesca Dell’Oro, together with Corine Rossari, both from the
                    University of Neuchâtel, are the organisers of the course “<a href="https://langage.cuso.ch/?id=887&amp;tx_displaycontroller[showUid]=5409" target="_blank">Linguistique historique et
                        linguistique
                        de
                        corpus : perspectives syntaxiques, sémantiques et pragmatiques avec un regard sur la
                        modalité</a>” offered as part of
                    <a href="https://www.cuso.ch" target="_blank">CUSO</a>’s <a href="https://langage.cuso.ch/accueil" target="_blank">PhD Program in Language Sciences</a>.</p>

                <p>The goal of the course is to discuss how the methods in Historical Linguistics have been influenced
                    by
                    the advances in Corpus Linguistics through the presentation of different uses cases. The study of
                    modality will be specifically addressed. The course will
                    take
                    place on the 18th and 19th of October, 2021, in Les Diablerets (Bernese Alps).</p>

                <h2>The Empiris Foundation funds corpus linguistics project focused on modality</h2>
                <img src="resources/images/news/empiris.png"/>
                <p>The Empiris Foundation has recently announced the projects that will be supported through the Jakob
                    Wüest funding call, and the project <em>Les corpora latins et français : une fabrique pour l’accès à
                        la représentation des connaissances</em> (<em>Latin and French corpora: a factory to access
                        knowledge representation</em>), led by Francesca Dell’Oro and Corine Rossari (both University of
                    Neuchâtel) is among them. The keystone of the project is the creation of comparable corpora in Latin
                    and French from which it will be possible to study the way in which knowledge is represented in both
                    languages. Modality will receive a close examination, thus these corpora will contain analytical
                    information concerning the grammatical and lexical features that codify the attitude of the speakers
                    in relation to their utterances. The corpora will be published in a support that will enable
                    systematic queries and statistical analyses.
                </p>
                <p>The project has received a subsidy of 20,000 CHF. The team will consist of the directors of the
                    project, Francesca Dell’Oro and Corinne Rossari, and two postdoctoral researchers, Helena Bermúdez
                    Sabel and Cyrielle Montrichard. The starting date has not been announced yet.

                <img src="resources/images/news/dh2020.png" alt="DH2020 carrefours/intersections" class="cloud"/>

                <p>The members of the WoPoss team have three abstracts accepted in the <a href="https://dh2020.adho.org/" target="_blank">annual conference</a> of the Alliance of
                    Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO) that is planned to take place in Ottawa from the 22nd to the
                    24th of July.</p>

                <p>Francesca Dell’Oro will give an overview of our SNF-project in the short paper
                    “<a href="outputs/OpenAccessDiachronyModality.pdf" target="_blank">WoPoss - A World of
                        Possibilities. An open access annotated corpus to study the diachrony of
                        modality
                        in the Latin language</a>”. Paola Marongiu will do a lighting talk presenting her PhD project
                    which is
                    being developed in the framework of the project: “<a target="_blank" href="outputs/co-occurrences.pdf">Co-occurrence
                        of modal markers: a network analysis
                        approach</a>”. Last but not least the complete team (H. Bermúdez Sabel, F. Dell’Oro &amp; P.
                    Marongiu) will discuss the visualization of semantic maps and its
                    application to modality in Latin with the poster “<a target="_blank" href="outputs/semantic_maps.pdf">Visualization
                        of semantic shifts: the case of modal
                        markers</a>”.</p>

                <p>The current situation is putting on hold many scientific events, but also showing the important of
                    working with Open Data. Our team deeply believe in Open Science! On May 1<sup>st</sup>, ADHO and the
                    DH2020
                    organizers will provide an update regarding the conference. We hope that the event can take place:
                    the
                    lively and in-depth discussions of previous editions have shown its importance for the development
                    of
                    the DH field and the reinforcement and expansion of its community.</p>

                <p>Looking forward to seeing you in Ottawa!</p>

                <img src="resources/images/news/word-cloud.png" alt="word cloud multilingual words of fear" class="cloud"/>
                <p>We are currently working on an exposition concerning the words of fear, especially
                    those that have taken a positive value throughout time. We have individuated for now three types of
                    words:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>As in French <em>formidable</em>: etymologically related to the feeling of fear (Latin
                        <em>formidabilis</em>
                        ⇒ “inspiring fear, frightening, terrifying”), it is now mainly used with the meaning “great,
                        fantastic”;
                    </li>
                    <li>As in English <em>terrific</em>: also etymologically related to fear (Latin <em>terreo</em> ⇒
                        “to terrorize”) it
                        can
                        now be used both with a positive (“amazing”) and a negative (“terrible”) meaning;
                    </li>

                    <li>As in French <em>terriblement</em>, German <em>schrecklich</em>, English <em>awfully</em>,
                        adverbs etymologically related
                        to
                        fear and that can nowadays intensify an adjective in both a positive and a negative way.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>We would like to enlarge the list as much as possible with words matching these three categories
                    and coming from as many languages as possible. Do you happen to have any ideas and feel like you
                    would like to contribute to our list? If so, please feel free to contact us: <a href="mailto:woposs@unine.ch">woposs@unine.ch</a>
