            <h1>Samples</h1>
            <p>The corpus spans
                from the 3rd
                BCE to the 7th
                century CE, and besides the different textual types and genres, we
                also took into consideration the diverse sources of transmission of ancient texts.</p>
            <p>This section will provide a search interface to access our annotated corpus. Meanwhile, you
            can have a glimpse of our annotation by visualizing Tertullian’s <em>De spectaculis</em> as annotated by Séverine Reymond and
                reviewed by Francesca Dell’Oro in INCEpTION. Please notice that this is not the final annotated file: it is the result
                of the automatic annotation of linguistic features and the manual annotation of modal passages. More metadata and corrections will be added later on.</p>
            <p>Instructions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the <a href="outputs/copy_of_WoPoss_project.zip" target="_blank">file</a>.</li>
                <li>Go to the <a href="https://morbo.ukp.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/demo" target="_blank">INCEpTION demo</a> website.</li>
                <li>After logging in, go to the right upper corner and, in “Import project files”, select the file you downloaded in step 1 (it must be a zip file: if your browser/operating system decompresses the folder by default, compress it as a .zip file). Then click on “Upload selected files”.</li>
                <li>Once the project was correctly imported, pay attention to green pop-up at the left bottom corner stating
                    the name of the uploaded project (as default the name is “copy_of_WoPoss” but if
                    other users have previously uploaded and not deleted the file, the name will change to avoid a rewriting). Select it on the list of projects to open it.</li>
                <li>Go to “Annotation” to overview the semantic annotation of <em>De spectaculis</em>.</li>
                <li>After you finish, you may go back to the dashboard (upper menu), select “Settings” and click of the red button “Delete” (upper right corner).</li>
            </ol>
