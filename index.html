        <em>A world of possibilities. Modal pathways over an extra-long period of time: the
            diachrony of modality in the Latin language</em> (WoPoss) aims at reconstructing the
        evolution of modal meanings from the prehistory of the Latin language up to the 7th century
        CE. The WoPoss team is working on the linguistic annotation of a selection of modal markers
        in a diachronic corpus of Latin literary and documentary texts. As annotation progresses,
        data will be made available during the project lifespan (February 2019–January 2023). </p>
