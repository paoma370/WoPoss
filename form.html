        <h2>Some notes to read before using</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Our project annotates 
                passages in which the any of our selected markers express a meaning of necessity, possibility and volition, even if there is no state of affairs.
                You can disable this option in the query form. The table of results allows you to easily see which passages do 
                not have a state of affairs, in case you want to filter the results after carrying out a query.
            </li>
            <li>Do not select all the options in a given fieldset to improve performance: filters are for filtering the
                results, thus if you want to see ALL the possibilities, just leave that fieldset
                empty (e.g., if you want to examine both the negative and affirmative polarity of
                the marker, do not check any of the options of the fieldset <em>Description of the
                    marker &gt; Polarity</em>). Selecting all the options will unnecessary slow the
                performance</li>
            <li>If one of your queries contains an ambiguous reading, you will always received the
                other possible reading(s). This means that if you carry out a query like <em>debeo -
                    deontic</em> you will see the dynamic interpretation of any ambiguous passage
                (the column “Ambiguous” in the table of results will inform you of this).</li>
        </ul>
