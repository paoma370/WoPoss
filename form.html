        <h2>Some notes for beta testers</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Should I search by modal marker or by modal relation? Functionalities of both forms
                are quite similar in the sense that in the search by modal marker you can filter by
                main modal meaning (thus you can select <em>debeo</em> and then only get its deontic
                occurrences) and in the search by modal meaning you can first select the modal
                meaning (with all the subcategories) and then filter by the lemma of the modal
                marker (thus you can select “deontic” in the first fieldset and then only obtain all
                the occurrences of <em>debeo</em>). If you are looking for a specific modal category
                (e.g. <em>deontic &gt; authority &gt; official context</em>), go to the “Search by
                modal meaning” form; if you want to focus on a specific marker (and for instance see
                the cases in which it is not modal) use the “Search my modal marker” form. By having
                two different forms is easier to develop a more intuitive form depending on the
                needs of the user, and also to enhance performance.</li>
            <li>Never select all the options in a given fieldset: filters are for filtering the
                results, thus if you want to see ALL the possibilities, just leave that fieldset
                empty (e.g., if you want to examine both the negative and affirmative polarity of
                the marker, do not check any of the options of the fieldset <em>Description of the
                    marker &gt; Polarity</em>). Selecting all the options will unnecessary slow the
                performance</li>
            <li>If one of your queries contains an ambiguous reading, you will always received the
                other possible reading(s). This means that if you carry out a query like <em>debeo -
                    deontic</em> you will see the dynamic interpretation of any ambigous passage
                (the column “Ambiguous” in the table of results should be intuitive enough.</li>
        </ul>
